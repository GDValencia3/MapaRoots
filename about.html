            <p><strong>Mapa Roots</strong> was created to be an acceessible resource, a multi-lingual roadmap, predominantly focused in helping families navigate services, resources, and public systems in the state of California. <em>Gizella Valencia</em> began the organization in hopes of being an asset in bridging the gap of information within non-english speaking families; especially now as the technological gap between social groups enlarges. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Gizella's parents began their journey in California as immigrants, they migrated from Mexico in the 1980's. They navigated through a new system, culture, and the "new rules of life" knowing only one language, spanish. It was extremely challenging for her and realized it affected the dynamics within her individual and family identity. <strong>Mapa Roots </strong> started as an annihilated idea, with a vision in mind, to ease the navigation process and offer the support she wished her family was given.

            <p><em>Ma</em> is in reference to my mother, <em>Pa</em> is reference to my father, yet both perfectly come together to form <em> Mapa</em>, a map in spanish. I want to highlight that although my family structure seems traditional, all family structures are welcomed on this platform. This community does not fall short of support and acceptance, our unique indviduality belongs, and therefore our collective mindset is enhanced. <strong>Mapa Roots</strong> is a place where you and yours feel safe and supported, just like any family should make you feel.
            <br>
            <br> 
            My mission for <strong> Mapa Roots</strong> is to promote learning, informed decison making, cohesiveness, and a stonger supportive foundation within each family. Social equity  and responsibility is at the forefront of everything I do, and I know that as technology enhances the gap towards a more equittable society will be further of reach. That means that the most marginilized, under-served, and under-represented communites will have limited access to information... not unless we make the transition as accessible as possible. I hope that <strong>Mapa Roots</strong> will make a meaninful difference and connect individuals and families to the information they deserve to succeed."
